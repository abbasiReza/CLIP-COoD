# Deciphering the Role of Representation Disentanglement: Investigating Compositional Generalization in CLIP Models

## Overview
Welcome to the official repository for our ECCV 2024 accepted paper, *"Deciphering the Role of Representation Disentanglement: Investigating Compositional Generalization in CLIP Models."* This project explores the compositional out-of-distribution (C-OoD) generalization capabilities of CLIP models, focusing on how these models handle unseen combinations of known concepts.
