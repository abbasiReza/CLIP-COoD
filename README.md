# Deciphering the Role of Representation Disentanglement: Investigating Compositional Generalization in CLIP Models
## Overview
Welcome to the official repository for our ECCV 2024 accepted paper, "Deciphering the Role of Representation Disentanglement: Investigating Compositional Generalization in CLIP Models." This project explores the compositional out-of-distribution (C-OoD) generalization capabilities of CLIP models, focusing on how these models handle unseen combinations of known concepts.
